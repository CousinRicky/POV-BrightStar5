# BrightStar5
Selected data derived from the Yale Bright Star Catalogue, preliminary 5th ed., converted to POV-Ray SDL. This catalog contains all nighttime stars of magnitude 6.5 and brighter (roughly all nighttime stars visible to the naked eye), plus a few dimmer ones. Macros are included for star coloration and Bayer designation labels.

This project is a module from the Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray) Object Collection.
